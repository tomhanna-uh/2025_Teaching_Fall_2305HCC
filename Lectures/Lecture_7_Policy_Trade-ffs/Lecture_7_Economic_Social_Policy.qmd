# Economic, Social and Environmental Policy: Collective Action Problems, Trade-offs, and Unintended Consequences





## Why Public Policy is Necessary: Collective Action Problems

- Collective Action Problems: Individuals would benefit from cooperating but incentives not to cooperate are stronger

- Collective Action Problems: lack of information, coordination, or trust among individuals.



## Is government action the only solution?

- Markets actually solve far more collective action problems than government

        - Existing markets
        - Privatization of government enterprises

- Private governance structures - polycentric governance


## Collective action problems and Market Failures


- Externalities
- Free rider problems
- Tragedy of the Commons 



## Externalities

## Positive Externalities

## Externalities Problem 

- Negative externalities: *overproduction* because the cost is not included in the price
- Positive externalities: *underproduction* because the benefit is not included in the price

## Potential solutions

- Government solutions to externalities

        - lawsuits - U
        - bureaucratic regulation - E, I, A, P
        - Congressional regulation - E,D, I, p
        - assigning property rights - F,U,P
        - taxes and subsidies - F,E,D
        
- Pros and Cones

        F = Efficient: Those who benefit bear the full cost
        I = inefficient
        E = Equal
        U = Unequal
        D = Democratic
        A = Anti-democratic
        P = politically unpopular

## Solutions to free rider problems

- Easy

        - Accept the free riders
        - Those who want to pay, pay
        
- Government Solutions

        - Taxes
        - User fees, tolls, etc. 
        - Regulation to exclude free riders 

- Private solutions

        - Private governance structures
        - Private contracts
        - Private insurance

# Judging public policy trade-offs

## Judging Public Policy Trade-offs: Collective Benefits vs Individual Rights

- Free riders and taxation
- Public health vs. *vice* laws and excise taxes

        - alcohol tax
        - marijuana prohibition
        - cigarette taxes
        - prohibition of flavored cigarettes
        - soda taxes
        
## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*


## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*



## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*
- *financial costs* of enforcement - just the beginning


## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*
- *financial costs* of enforcement - just the beginning
- *Human costs of enforcement* 


## The trade-off
        
- The trade off: not just about *public benefit* vs *private wants and needs*
- benefit vs *cost of enforcement*

## Uninented Consequences Add Complexity

- Unintended consequences of public policy make it even more difficult to judge the trade-offs
- Unintended consequences: the results of actions that were not foreseen or intended by a purposeful action.




## Unintended consequences Examples

- Policy: Raising "sin" taxes 

        - People use less and revenue drops
        - Black markets are created - crime increases
        - Black market are created - revenue drops



## Unintended consequences Examples

- Raising "sin" taxes 
- Ban of pesticide DDT in 1972

        - millions of mosquito born illness deaths
        - sickness related financial costs to individuals, families, and governments


## Unintended consequences Examples

- Raising "sin" taxes 
- Ban of pesticide DDT in 1972
- Three strikes laws and capital punishment for rape or kidnapping


## Unintended consequences Examples

- Raising "sin" taxes 
- Ban of pesticide DDT in 1972
- Three strikes laws and capital punishment for rape or kidnapping

        - Criminals want no witnesses
        

## Unintended consequences Examples

- Raising "sin" taxes 
- Ban of pesticide DDT in 1972
- Three strikes laws and capital punishment for rape or kidnapping

        - Criminals want no witnesses
        - increase in murders
        


## Unintended consequences Examples


[Ten Examples of Unintended Consequences](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/ten-examples-of-the-law-of-unintended-consequences/)


## Unintended Consequences 

- Unintended consequences are an important *trade-off*


## Unintended Consequences 

- Unintended consequences are an important trade-off
- They are not *always* predictable 




## Unintended Consequences 

- Unintended consequences are an important trade-off
- They are not *always* predictable 
- They should be *expected* and *considered*



## Unintended Consequences 

- Unintended consequences are an important trade-off
- They are not *always* predictable 
- They should be *expected* and *considered*


## Road to Serfdom

- F.A. Hayek - Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (1974)
- Instead of repealing bad economic regulations because of unintended consequences, we pass more more economic regulations with more unintended consequences

- WWII, response to totalitarianism in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia

## Road to Serfdom

- F.A. Hayek - Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (1974)
- Instead of repealing bad laws because of unintended consequences, we pass more laws with more unintended consequences

- Hayek focus: economic central planning

![Federal Spending Categories: 2024-2025](budget.png)



## Judging Public Policy Trade-offs: Short-term vs Long-term Benefits


- Higher spending now vs. Higher taxes later
- More educations spending now vs. economic growth later
- More infrastructure spending now vs. economic growth later
- More regulation now vs. fewer, lower paid jobs later
- More consumption now vs. environmental issues later
- Lower immigration now vs. population decline later
- Higher taxes now vs. slower poverty reduction


## Recap

- Collective action problems and market failures
- Government is not the only solution
- Where government is the solution, trade-offs should be considered carefully including:

        - policy benefits versus individual freedoms and human costs
        - economic and social trade-offs
        - short-term versus long-term benefits
        
- The right solution in every case is to carefully consider all the trade-offs and make the best decision considering all aspects of the problem and potential solutions.
